Numeracy 

Shapes :
- Classifies objects into groups based on a few physical attributes such
as shape, size and other observable properties including rolling and
sliding
- Develops and uses vocabulary of spatial relationship
(Top, Bottom, On, Under, Inside, Outside, Above,
Below, Near, Far, Before, After)

Solids:
- Collects objects from the surroundings having different sizes and shapes like pebbles, boxes, balls, cones, pipes, etc.
- Sorts, Classifies and describes the objects on the basis of shapes, and other observable properties.
- Observes and describes the way shapes affect movements like rolling and sliding.
- Sorts 2 - D shapes such as flat objects made of card etc.

Describes the physical features of various solids/shapes in her own language. For example- a ball rolls, a box slides, etc.

NUMBERNESS , C OUNTING AND OPERATIONS OF 

NUMBERS 1 - 9 AND ZERO :
- Observes object and makes collections of objects. Arranges the collection of objects in order by
	- Matching and
	- One to one correspondence
- Counts the number of objects in a collection.
- Makes collection of objects corresponding to a specific
number.
- Recognises and speaks numbers from 1 to 9.
- Uses numbers from 1 to 9 in counting and
comparison. (Real objects and repeated events like
clapping to be used for counting)
- Reads and writes numerals from 1 to 9.
- Adds and subtracts using real objects and pictures.
- Adds and subtracts the numbers using symbols ‘+’
and ‘-’.
- Approaches zero through the subtraction pattern (such
as 3 – 1 = 2, 3 – 2 = 1, 3 – 3 = 0).

NUMBERS 10 - 20 :
- Forms Number sequence from 10 to 20.
- Counts objects using these numbers.
- Groups objects into a group of 10s and single objects.
- Develops the vocabulary of group of ‘tens’ and ‘ones’.
- Shows the group of tens and ones by drawing.
- Counts the number of tens and ones in a given number.
- Writes the numerals for eleven to nineteen.
- Writes numerals for ten and twenty.
- Compares numbers upto 20.
- Adds and subtracts numbers upto 20.

NUMBERS 21 - 99 : 
- Writes numerals for Twenty-one to Ninety nine.·
Groups objects into tens and ones.
- Draws representation for groups of ten and ones.
- Groups a number orally into tens and ones.
- Compares numbers.
- Forms greatest and smallest numbers using given digits

ARITHMETIC :
ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
- Adds and subtracts numbers by writing them vertically in the following two cases:
	– without regrouping.
	– with regrouping.
- Uses the place value in standard algorithm of addition and subtraction.
- Solves addition and subtraction problems in different situations presented through pictures and stories.
- Frames problems for addition and subtraction facts.
- Estimates the sum of, and difference between, two given numbers.

MULTIPLICATION
- Explains the meaning of multiplication (as repeated addition).
- Identifies the sign of multiplication.
- Constructs the multiplication tables of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10
- Uses multiplication facts in situations.
- Multiplies two digit numbers using standard algorithm and Lattice multiplication algorithm.

DIVISION
- Explains the meaning of division from context of equal grouping and sharing.
- Relates division with multiplication.
 Completes division facts:
	– by grouping
	– by using multiplication tables.
- Divides a given number by another number in various ways such as:
	– by drawing dots.
	– by grouping.
	- by using multiplication facts.
	– by repeated subtraction.
- Applies the four operations to life situations.
- Frames word problems.
- Estimates sums, differences and products of given numbers.
- Uses informal and standard division algorithms.
- Explains the meaning of factors and multiples.

Construct addition facts up to 9 by using concrete objects. For example, to find 3+3 counts 3 steps forward from 3 and concludes that 3+3=6
Subtracts numbers using 1 to 9. For example, the child takes out 3 objects from a collection of 9 objects and counts the remaining to conclude 9-3=6
Solves day-to-day problems related to addition and subtraction of numbers up to 9
Recognises numbers up to 99 and writes numerals

MONEY :
- Identifies common currency notes and coins.
- Puts together small amounts of money.

- Distinguishes between near, far, thin, thick, longer/taller, shorter, high, low.
- Seriates objects by comparing their length

Count objects up to 20.
Reads and writes numbers up to 99.
Using additions and subtraction of numbers up to 9 in daily life situations.
Estimates and verifies length using non-standard, non-uniform units

Measurement 
Identifies basic shapes: circle, square, triangle. Compares lengths or sizes by observation (big/small, longer/shorter).

Estimates and measures short lengths using non uniform units like a finger, hand span, length of a forearm, footsteps, etc.

Distinguishes between near, far, thin, thick, longer/taller, shorter, high, low. 
	- Seriates objects by comparing their length

Measures short lengths in terms of non-uniform units (in the context of games e.g. ‘Gilli Danda’ and ‘marble-games’).
Estimates distance and length, and verifies using non-uniform units (e.g. hand span etc.)

TIME:
- Distinguishes between events occurring in time using terms -earlier and later.
- Gets the qualitative feel of long & short duration, of school days v/s holidays.
- Narrates the sequence of events in a day

DATA HANDLING & PATTERNS :
- Collects, represents and interprets simple data such as measuring the arm length or circumference of the head using a paper strip.
- Observes, extends and creates patterns of shapes and numbers. For example, arrangement of shapes/ objects/ numbers, etc.
- Collects, records (using pictures/numerals) and interprets simple information by looking at visuals. (For example in a picture of a garden the child looks at different flowers and draws inference that flowers of a certain colour are more).

EVS : 
Identifies family members, common fruits/animals. Knows uses of water, needs of the body ( food, sleep)
